# Sanity Studio

In this demo including Sanity as well, I tried to cover some main parts, kept a basic level:

- Structures
- Schemas
- Preview
- Media
- Theming (colors)

The products come from Sanity, of course when Shopify, Salesforce or any other mean of fetching the products would be implemented, then we either feed Sanity with the products, or we fetch the products directly from the source. I checked and Sanity has an integration with Shopify where your products are automatically updated in Sanity for example.
